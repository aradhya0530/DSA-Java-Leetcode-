Question-
You are given an array of characters letters that is sorted in non-decreasing order, and a character target. There are at least two different characters in letters.
Return the smallest character in letters that is lexicographically greater than target. If such a character does not exist, return the first character in letters.

Solution-
class Solution {
  public char nextGreatestLetter(char[] letters, char target) {
    int l = 0;
    int r = letters.length;

    while (l < r) {
      final int m = (l + r) / 2;
      if (letters[m] > target)
        r = m;
      else
        l = m + 1;
    }

    return letters[l % letters.length];
  }
}
