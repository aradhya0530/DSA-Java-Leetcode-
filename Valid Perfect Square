Question-
Given a positive integer num, return true if num is a perfect square or false otherwise.
A perfect square is an integer that is the square of an integer. In other words, it is the product of some integer with itself.
You must not use any built-in library function, such as sqrt

Solution-
class Solution {

    public boolean isPerfectSquare(int num) {
        int low = 1;
        int high = num;
        while (low <= high) {
            long mid = (low + high) >>> 1;
            if (mid * mid == num) {
                return true;
            } else if (mid * mid < num) {
                low = (int) mid + 1;
            } else {
                high = (int) mid - 1;
            }
        }
        return false;
    }


}
