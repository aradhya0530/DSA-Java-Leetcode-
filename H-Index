Question-
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return the researcher's h-index.
According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: The h-index is defined as the maximum value of h such that the given researcher has published at least h papers
that have each been cited at least h times.

Solution-
class Solution {
  public int hIndex(int[] citations) {
    int n = citations.length;
    int[] count = new int[n + 1];
    int[] S = new int[n + 1];
    for (int i = 0; i < citations.length; i++) {
      if (citations[i] > n) {
        citations[i] = n;
      }
    }
    for (int citation : citations) {
      count[citation]++;
    }
    S[n] = count[n];
    for (int i = n - 1; i >= 0; i--) {
      S[i] = count[i] + S[i + 1];
    }
    for (int i = n; i >= 0; i--) {
      if (i <= S[i]) {
        return i;
      }
    }
    return 0;
  }
}
