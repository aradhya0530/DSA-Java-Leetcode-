Question-
You are given an array prices where prices[i] is the price of a given stock on the ith day, and an integer fee representing a transaction fee.
Find the maximum profit you can achieve. You may complete as many transactions as you like, but you need to pay the transaction fee for each transaction.
Note: You may not engage in multiple transactions simultaneously (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).
Solution-
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices, int fee) {
        int n = prices.length;
        int[] free = new int[n], hold = new int[n];
        
        // In order to hold a stock on day 0, we have no other choice but to buy it for prices[0].
        hold[0] = -prices[0];
        
        for (int i = 1; i < n; i++) {
            hold[i] = Math.max(hold[i - 1], free[i - 1] - prices[i]);
            free[i] = Math.max(free[i - 1], hold[i - 1] + prices[i] - fee);
        }
        
        return free[n - 1];
    }
}
