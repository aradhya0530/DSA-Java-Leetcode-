Question-
You are climbing a staircase. It takes n steps to reach the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Example-
Input: n = 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps

Solution-
class Solution {
  public int climbStairs(int n) {
    if (n == 0 || n == 1) return 1;
    int[] A = new int[n + 1];
    A[n] = 1;
    A[n - 1] = 1;
    for (int i = n - 2; i >= 0; i--) A[i] = A[i + 1] + A[i + 2];
    return A[0];
  }
}
