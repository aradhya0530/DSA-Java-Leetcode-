Question-
Our hero Teemo is attacking an enemy Ashe with poison attacks! When Teemo attacks Ashe, Ashe gets poisoned for a exactly duration seconds. More formally, an attack at second t will mean Ashe is poisoned during the inclusive time interval [t, t + duration - 1]. If Teemo attacks again before the poison effect ends, the timer for it is reset, and the poison effect will end duration seconds after the new attack.
You are given a non-decreasing integer array timeSeries, where timeSeries[i] denotes that Teemo attacks Ashe at second timeSeries[i], and an integer duration.
Return the total number of seconds that Ashe is poisoned.

Solution-
class Solution {
  public int findPoisonedDuration(int[] timeSeries, int duration) {
    if (duration == 0)
      return 0;

    int ans = 0;

    for (int i = 0; i + 1 < timeSeries.length; ++i)
      ans += Math.min(timeSeries[i + 1] - timeSeries[i], duration);

    return ans + duration;
  }
}
